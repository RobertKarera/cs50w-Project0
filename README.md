Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My Project is about a short introduction about me.

It is consisted by following pages 
    1.Home(index.html)
    2.Academics(about us.html)
    3.Work(service.html)
    4.Gallery(gallery.html)
    5.Contact(contact us.html)

It has two folders 
    1.style, which has CSS and SCSS stylesheets
    2.images, which contain all the image that are used in this project

The Home(index.html) page

    has a navigation bar using lists and html links
    image tag and introduction div using bootstrap grid model
    The education background is lis listed in a tble
    skills are listed using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
    a footer for copyright is on the bottom of the page

Academics(about us.html)
    This is made using SCSS variable

Work(service.html)

    it has different lists. so, to differenciate their styling I used SCSS nesting

Gallery(gallery.html)

    a bunch of picture is uploaded in the gallery page

5.Contact(contact us.html)

    My addresses are styled using SCSS inheritance
